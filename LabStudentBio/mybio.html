			<li><strong>Welcome to My Page Dedicated to Everything About Me!</strong></li>
			<li><strong>____________________________________</strong></li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Hobbies</strong></li>
			<p> <br>Other than programming and computer related hobbies, I enjoy working on cars, skateboarding, snowboarding, and art. <br><br>
			I currently own a 95 Mazda Miata. I have done a very lengthy list of mods to make it track ready. I have been autocrossing it for 
			close to two years now. <br><br>
			I have been snowboarding and skateboarding since a very young age. It's one of those hobbies I can't let go. All my buddies still
			skate and snowboard, so I'm constantly being able to perfect my craft and skills.

			<img src="img/atcomm_logo.png" alt="AtComm">
			<p><br> I recently started my internship at AtComm Corporation in Manchester, NH. AtComm provides a piece of software to report
			on telephone traffic within a business. <br>Some technology used are the.NET framework, AngularJS, jQuery, Sybase databases, and SignalR.
			I have been doing a lot of debugging of Crystal Reports and on their web application.<br>
			they also have many small .NET projects that I'll be involved with in the future.
